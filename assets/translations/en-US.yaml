Since Peak filter and Dip filter shares the same center frequency, you can actually see 8 graphs were drawn. the number of bands can't go lower than 2 or, higher than 25.",
  "HELP_GAIN": "'Gain' affects how much the EQ Filter will alter your audio clip. if you set the Gain value higher, the difference is more audible and easier to hear.",
  "HELP_QFACTOR": "'Q Factor' determines the band-width of EQ Filter. Higher Q Factor means Wider EQ Filter, which is more audible and easier to identify.",
  "HELP_FILTER": "'Filter' modes affect whether your audio clip is boosted(Peak) or cut(Dip). You can make the filter to either boost or cut original audio clips.(Peak & Dip).",
  "HELP_POINTLIMIT": "'Point Limit' will control the number of bands, depending your session performance. As you choose correct/incorrect answers, the 'Round Point' will be increased/decreased by 1. if your point's absolute value hits the 'Point Limit', the number of bands will be increased/decreased by 1 and the 'Round Point' will be reset to 0.",
